### Experience

**AWS Security** *Senior Software Development Engineer* __2019-02 to present__
  Tech lead and SME for an internal AWS account management service.  Designing a system to protect and limit the access to Production AWS account resources.
	**Technical Environment** Java, Javascript, Ruby On Rails, MySQL.

**AWS Security** *Software Development Engineer II* __2017-02 to 2019-02__
  Tech lead and SME for an internal AWS account management service.  Led the design and implementation for the control plane of an internal SSO authentication platform for all of Amazon.  Designed and created a web-based SSH client for internal use at Amazon in my spare time (the service has been funded and launched for Production).  Designed and created an authorization service to protect errant operator actions from affecting Production systems.
	**Technical Environment** Java, Javascript, Ruby On Rails, MySQL, NodeJS, React, AWS Services.

**AWS Security** *Software Development Engineer I* __2015-02 to 2017-02__
  Worked on a "Tier 0" internal AWS account management service.  Led the design for the re-architecture of the data plane in order to provide regional redundancy and high availability.  Created an IAM User access key rotation algorithm to ensure access keys are rotated securely and safely.
	**Technical Environment** Java, Javascript, Ruby On Rails, MySQL.

------

### Research

**Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute** *Worldwide Computing Laboratory* __2012-02 to 2014-12__
  Designed and created a distributed Face Recognition Application.  This application consisted of a "farmer" actor with an unknown face.  The application would spawn various "worker" actors to find the closest match based on their own personal face databases.  We observed a performance and accuracy increase when offloading the "worker" actors from the mobile device to the cloud.
	**Technical Environment** Android, SALSA, Java, OpenCV.
  Designed and created a Data Analytics Computational Steering Framework.  The framework would drive computation towards the highest confidence result based on a certain allotted time for processing.  The framework supported moving computation between mobile devices, private clouds, and the public cloud based on time or budget constraints.
	**Technical Environment** SALSA, Java.
